   * Trigger: Post-Strava connect & profile setup.
   * Inputs: userId, Strava History (Activities), User profile (DOB/Gender?).
   * Logic: Analyze frequency, intensity, consistency, PBs. Estimate fitness (Pace/HR, VO2Max?). Generate safe recommendations.
   * Outputs: Updates RunnerProfile (experience, fitness, PBs); Returns initial recommendations/insights object.
   * Notes: Async processing likely needed. Prioritize safety in recommendations.
2. Training Plan Generation:
   * Purpose: Create personalized, structured plan.
   * Trigger: POST /training-plans.
   * Inputs: userId, Goal, PlanPreferences, RunnerProfile, recent training load?.
   * Logic: Select template, determine duration, progress mileage safely (~10% rule, down weeks), schedule workout types based on prefs/principles, define workout details (pace/HR/RPE targets, components) based on fitness/goal, generate descriptions, assign days, ensure phases (Base, Build, Peak, Taper).
   * Outputs: TrainingPlan object (status: Preview).
   * Notes: Target < 30s generation. Strict safety rules on progression.

3. API Security: Input validation, output encoding, rate limiting, security headers, least privilege API keys.
4. Input Validation: Rigorous server-side validation (type, format, length, range, enums). Sanitize inputs (beware prompt injection).
5. 3rd Party: Secure secret storage (Replit Secrets -> GCP Secret Manager). Validate webhooks. Minimize Strava scopes. Secure AI service comms, mindful of data sent.
6. Infra & Deployment: Secure cloud config (firewalls, IAM least privilege). Container security (scan images, run minimal). Patch management. Secure CI/CD (protect secrets).
7. Dependencies: Vulnerability scanning (Snyk/Dependabot), update policy.
8. Logging & Monitoring: Log security events (logins, failures, changes). Secure log storage. No sensitive data in logs. Monitor for suspicious activity, set alerts.
